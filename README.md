The [BSDS500 dataset](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/resources.html) is usually seperated into a training set of 432 images and a testing set of 68 images. Note that in the original BSD paper, the test set of 68 images were not defined. Rather, it seems that these 68 test images were first introduced by Roth and Black [1], where the test image IDs can be found [here](https://www.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/vi_research/code/foe.en.jsp). In this repository, we collect the colored version of the training images and testing images. The 432 training images are collected from [here](https://github.com/drorsimon/CSCNet/tree/master/datasets/CBSD432) and the testing images are collected from [here](https://github.com/clausmichele/CBSD68-dataset/tree/master/CBSD68/original_png).
